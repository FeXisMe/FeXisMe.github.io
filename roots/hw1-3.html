    <h1>This is a divided paragraph.</h1>
    <div id="sectionL">
        <h2>I call this area "SectionLeft".</h2>
        </p>Just like the brain, I put logical understanding, memory, time, language, judgment, arrangement, classification, logic, analysis, writing, reasoning, inhibition, five senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste), and other ways of thinking into the left section. This gives continuity, continuity, and analysis to the behavior in the left section.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 75%;">That's how brain works.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="sectionR">
        <h2>Then this one must be "SectionRight".</h2>
        <p>I put spatial image memory, intuition, emotion, body coordination, visual perception, art, music rhythm, imagination, inspiration, epiphany and other ways of thinking into the right area. This makes it disorderly, jumpy, intuitive, etc. Just like the right brain, it has pictorial functions such as planning, creativity, and imagination. The right brain is like a universal doctor, good at finding multiple solutions to problems, and many advanced thinking functions depend on the right brain.</p>
